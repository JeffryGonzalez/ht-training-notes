## Advanced Angular

This is a _three-day_ instructor-led course.

This course is designed to round-off an Angular developer's education by providing advanced techniques for managing state, writing complex selector functions, understanding the `rxjs` library and common operators. We will also learn advanced form validation including asynchronous validation with server side approval, as well as lazy-loading Angular modules. Building feature module libraries using NGRX Component State will also be presented.

### Prerequisites

This course is designed for established Angular developers who regularly deliver Angular application code in a team environment. A thorough understanding of both Angular and Redux State Management using @NGRX is required. Please consider taking the [Angular State Managment with NGRX](/angular-training/angular-ngrx) Course prior to taking this course. It is also helpful, but not necessary to have taken the [Angular Developer Testing](/angular-training/angular-testing) course prior to this course.

It is also helpful if developers have _some_ familiarity with creating server-side HTTP based APIs for this course.

### Objectives

The objective of this course is for developers to be able to undertand and implement the following:

#### Design Usable Forms with Custom Validation

> Forms in Angular, or any web application framework, are where we spend a lot of time as developers. We will learn techniques to design good form User Experience including Accessible forms with focus trapping, announce service, and `ARIA` attributes. We will also learn to create custom synchronous and asynchronous validation functions.

#### Server-Side Integration Patterns

> We will learn patterns to increase reliability and decrease complexity in Effects with patterns for integrating with back-end HTTP services. Developers will learn how to create custom Http interceptors in Angular to monitor and modify Http requests and responses (including Authorization headers), as well as the "Back-End for Front-End (BFF)" pattern to keep the back-end in sync with the front-end. Developers will aso learn how to honor HTTP Cache headers for resources kept in the NGRX Store.

#### Using Web Sockets For Stateful Clients

> This course will include a quick introduction to using stateful Web Sockets for both notifications from the server, and transparent syncing of data with the Back-End.

#### Lazy-Loading Angular Modules and Other Performance Enhancing Techniques

> As Angular applications grow, features are added for more specialized users. By Lazy Loading certain features only when the user needs them, we can increase our first "paint" time of the application. We will also learn how to use the browser developer tools to detect and mitigate other performance issues in our application, including load time, and component re-paint. Service workers will be introduced for doing background-processing of long-running client-side tasks.

#### Advanced CSS and Styling Techniques for Angular Developers

> Developers will have a deep-dive into Angular hierarchical styling, including component styles and how to control how styling changes impact child components. We will also look at technologies like SASS for pre-compiling your CSS for the browser, making style information more flexible and "themeable".

### Expected Outcome of this Training

At the conclusion of the Advanced Angular course, developers will:

- Know how to design usable forms with helpful user experience (UX).
- Understand Accessibility and ARIA for Angular Forms, including using special Angular facilities and services for Accessibility.
- Be able to build custom validators, pipes, and utilities in their Angular applications.
- Be able to implement a variety of patterns for simplifying API communications.
- Have the ability to detect and fix common performance issues in Angular applications.
- Be able to use modular CSS to promote reuse and prevent style-based regressions in new components.
