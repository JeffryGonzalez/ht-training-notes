# Services Developer Training

This set of courses is designed for developers designing and creating the server-side service architecture to support your organization or platform.

## Recommended Flow of Training

### Getting Started - Beginning Service Development

**New Course**

[Beginning .NET Service Development](services-training/devops-services) (3 days) is the recommended starting point. If you've been through previous Hypertheory training for services, including the Backend Services 100-300 Series (retired), this is mostly new information, and you should consider taking it.

### Building Web APIs

**Previously Backend Services 100**

The next course in the series is [Web APIs with .NET](services-training/web-api) (3 days).

This course is roughly equivalent to the previous Hypertheory Training course **Backend Services 100**.

### Building a Microservice Architecture

**Previously Backend Services 200**

Web APIs aren't the _only_ kind of services you will need, and you will also need to know good patterns for integrating services for applications.
The course [Microservice Development](services-training/microservice-development) (3 days) is the next course on the journey.

You should take this class after the [Beginning .NET Service Development](services-training/devops-services) and the [Web APIs with .NET](services-training/web-api) courses.

This course is roughly equivalent to the previous Hypertheory Training course **Backend Services 200**, with some content from the previous **Backend Services 300** course.

### Writing Developer Tests for Services

**New Course**

The [Services Developer Testing](services-training/developer-testing) course is a **new** course for 2022.

You can take this course any time after you've taken [Beginning .NET Service Development](services-training/devops-services) and [Web APIs with .NET](services-training/web-api).

### Event Driven Architectures

**New Course**

**Replacement for the previous Backend Services 300**

The [Building Event Driven Services](services-training/event-driven) is a **new** course for 2022. It replaces the previous Hypertheory Training course **Backend Services 300**, and is rewritten to provide updated information on architecting and implementing loosely coupled, enterprise-class service driven applications.

This is an **advanced** class, and participants should take [Microservice Development](services-training/microservice-development) prior to attending, and it is best if you have **considerable** experience building Microservice applications before attending.
