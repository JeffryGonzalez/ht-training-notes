## Developing Services with Go
### Overview

The Go Programming language from Google powers many of the technologies associated with "Cloud Native", including:

- Consul
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- OpenShift
- Terraform

As well as famous projects like Dropbox, Twitch, and a big part of Uber.

Go is particularly well suited for building services running in Cloud Native environments, and has fantastic networking and concurrency support "baked in".

This three-day course is meant to introduce developers to the programming language, and enable to them to build HTTP APIs using GO.
