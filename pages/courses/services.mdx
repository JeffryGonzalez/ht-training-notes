# DevOps and Services

This set of courses is designed for developers designing and creating the server-side service architecture to support your organization or platform.

## DevOps Essentials

This two-day course will prepare developers to work within a DevOps organization by understanding the mindset, technologies, and stragies employed to consistently deliver high-quality software to our customers.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to "level set" developers in the way modern software teams work, and, most importantly _how will this make your life as a developer better_.

This course is largely presentation, demonstration, with some hands-on exercises that don't require a high-degree of software development skills. We will start with an existing application and learn how to use DevOps techniques like CI/CD, source control, infrastructure as code, and containers and orchestration to safely evolve our software, monitor for problems, and deliver code confidently to our customers.

#### Why Are We Doing This?

> We will start with a discussion of what DevOps is, and what the responsibility (and payoffs!) are for developers and software development teams to share in the responsibility of how our code is delivered to customers. Most importantly, we will discuss _why_ this is so important now, and how we are finally able to fulfill the promises of methodologies like XP, Agile, and Lean.

#### Introduction to Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices

> We will learn about the challenges of building distributed applications, including applications that live "on premesis" and "in the cloud". We will define "Cloud Native", and learn how building applications (or refactoring existing applications) to microservices can be a pathway to extremely resiliant and performant code, as well as lowering the barrier to entry for new developers entering your team. Distributed applications are challenging. We need to think differently about service boundaries ("Bounded Contexts"), reliability and availability, and autonomous teams.

#### The Geography: Technology Landscape

> The buzzwords can be overwhelming. This section will introduce the enabling technologies that allow for Cloud Native development. We will learn about containers ("Docker"), orchestration ("Kubernetes and OpenShift"), Pipelines, Automated Testing, CI/CD, and how they are all used together to create a frictionless patch from business opportunity to working software. We will explore Azure DevOps, Github Actions, and other tools to automate our integration and delivery of software. There will also be a discussion of the software testing landscape within a DevOps organization.

#### Finding our Groove: How This Works in Practice (Developer Experience (DX))

> As a developer or member of a software development team, DevOps can feel a bit like something that is being done "to you" instead of "for you". We will experience how we use the feedback loops created in DevOps to reduce the friction between us and doing what we love - developing high quality software rapidly and getting it in front of our users with _confidence_. We will discuss and provide techniques for maturely discussing and resolving everything that gets between us and delivering high quality software to our customers.

#### "Live Site" Mindset - Feedback Loops from Production

> More than at any time in our history of software development, we have the tools and infrastructure at our disposal the emphasize the only environment that _really_ matters: Production. We will learn about _observability_ as a key piece of the DevOps tool set, and how we can react almost instantly to failures and performance issues that happen in production. We will also explore techniques like blue/green deployments, rolling updates (and rollbacks), as well as feature flags and toggles to enable CI/CD and "Canary" deployments.

## DevOps for Developers

This two-day course will prepare developers to deliver code in a DevOps organization.

### Prerequisites

This is developer training. We assume developers are proficient with C# and Visual Studio. Developers should take course [DevOps Essiential](#devops-essentials) before taking this course.

### Objectives

The objective of this course is for experienced developers to "upsize" their skills to successfully recognize and implement software coding and development patterns for a successful DevOps project.

#### Micro-Patterns For CI/CD

> Learn to understand and recognize the low-level decisions and approaches in software development and how they empower (or destroy) our ability to put code into production continually. We will explore _hypothesis driven development_ as a way to prove the necessity of a new feature before investing heavily in its development. We will begin to change our mindset as developers from "What can we add in our next sprint to move things forward" to "what can we add today to make sure we are building the _right thing_?"

#### Source Code Control in DevOps

> As developers, we have used source control of some form for years. Our brothers and sisters on the "operations" side are the ones that finally started to take the promise of source code control as the "Single Source of Truth" seriously. We have a lot to learn from them. In this section developers will learn the importance of using source code control (Git) to fully describe the current _desired_ state of our application, from the functionality of our code (build), the tests that ensure our understanding of the requirements, as well as the configuration and resources our application needs to run.

#### Networking Essentials for DevOps Developers

> As we, as developers, share the responsibility for how our applications run in production, we need to increase our knowledge of some _basic_ networking. We will discuss the major protocols (UDP, TCP), addressing, naming (DNS), discovery, and the restrictions of expecting reliable networking.

#### Cloud Native Development

> This section will enable developers to describe formally the requirements for their application by defining the containers in which their applications will run. Developers will learn to carefully construct `Dockerfile`s that build quickly and deploy instantly. We will discuss resource limits, base image selection, the necessity of rebuilding containers frequently (even if "nothing has changed"). We will also learn the key steps to creating deployments, services, and other supporting objects for running our containers in an orchestrated environment (Kubernetes/OpenShift).

#### Configuration Management

> In a DevOps environment we ship the configuration of our applications as part of our deliverables. We will look at how we use a variety of formats (JSON, YAML, etc.) to describe that configuration, and how configuration can be adjusted and "injected" into running services in Kubernetes/OpenShift.

#### Feature Flags and Branch by Abstraction

> A key question that arises when you finally start getting into the "flow" of DevOps is how to not get blocked when your team isn't the team that will (always) decide when your code is an "official release" that will go in front of users. We will be called daily to "work in the future", adding features and changing behaviour of our application through _configuration_. We will explore various techniques for enabling this kind of work, while still allowing us to deploy and test software continually, even though it might not be seen by a user in the current relase.
