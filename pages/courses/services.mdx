# DevOps and Services

This set of courses is designed for developers designing and creating the server-side service architecture to support your organization or platform.

## DevOps Essentials

This two-day course will prepare developers to work within a DevOps organization by understanding the mindset, technologies, and stragies employed to consistently deliver high-quality software to our customers.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to "level set" developers in the way modern software teams work, and, most importantly _how will this make your life as a developer better_.

This course is largely presentation, demonstration, with some hands-on exercises that don't require a high-degree of software development skills. We will start with an existing application and learn how to use DevOps techniques like CI/CD, source control, infrastructure as code, and containers and orchestration to safely evolve our software, monitor for problems, and deliver code confidently to our customers.

#### Why Are We Doing This?

> We will start with a discussion of what DevOps is, and what the responsibility (and payoffs!) are for developers and software development teams to share in the responsibility of how our code is delivered to customers. Most importantly, we will discuss _why_ this is so important now, and how we are finally able to fulfill the promises of methodologies like XP, Agile, and Lean.

#### Introduction to Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices

> We will learn about the challenges of building distributed applications, including applications that live "on premesis" and "in the cloud". We will define "Cloud Native", and learn how building applications (or refactoring existing applications) to microservices can be a pathway to extremely resiliant and performant code, as well as lowering the barrier to entry for new developers entering your team. Distributed applications are challenging. We need to think differently about service boundaries ("Bounded Contexts"), reliability and availability, and autonomous teams.

#### The Geography: Technology Landscape

> The buzzwords can be overwhelming. This section will introduce the enabling technologies that allow for Cloud Native development. We will learn about containers ("Docker"), orchestration ("Kubernetes and OpenShift"), Pipelines, Automated Testing, CI/CD, and how they are all used together to create a frictionless patch from business opportunity to working software. We will explore Azure DevOps, Github Actions, and other tools to automate our integration and delivery of software. There will also be a discussion of the software testing landscape within a DevOps organization.

#### Finding our Groove: How This Works in Practice (Developer Experience (DX))

> As a developer or member of a software development team, DevOps can feel a bit like something that is being done "to you" instead of "for you". We will experience how we use the feedback loops created in DevOps to reduce the friction between us and doing what we love - developing high quality software rapidly and getting it in front of our users with _confidence_. We will discuss and provide techniques for maturely discussing and resolving everything that gets between us and delivering high quality software to our customers.

#### "Live Site" Mindset - Feedback Loops from Production

> More than at any time in our history of software development, we have the tools and infrastructure at our disposal the emphasize the only environment that _really_ matters: Production. We will learn about _observability_ as a key piece of the DevOps tool set, and how we can react almost instantly to failures and performance issues that happen in production. We will also explore techniques like blue/green deployments, rolling updates (and rollbacks), as well as feature flags and toggles to enable CI/CD and "Canary" deployments.
