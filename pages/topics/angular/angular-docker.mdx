# Building a Docker Image for your Angular App with Nginx



<Callout>
This was created on November 2, 2021.
This is based on an Angular 12.x application.

## Creating the Dockerfile

In the root of your Angular app's project directory, create a `Dockerfile`. 

We will use a multi-stage build. Choose a version of the `node` base image that is closest to your locally installed version.

```shell
$ node --version
v14.17.6
```

In the below Dockerfile you will need to change the `COPY --from...` line so that is uses the right path for your built application.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14.17.6-slim AS build
WORKDIR /dist/src/app

RUN npm cache clean --force
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:latest AS ngi
COPY --from=build /dist/src/app/dist/courses-front-end /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY /nginx.conf  /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
```
## Docker Ignore

Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root of your project that has at a minimum the following:

```shell
.git
.editorconfig
/.vscode/*
/node_modules
.gitignore
```

## Nginx Configuration

Also in the root of your project, create an `nginx.conf` file, with content similiar to the following:

```text
server {
  listen 80;
  sendfile on;
  default_type application/octet-stream;

  gzip on;
  gzip_http_version 1.1;
  gzip_disable      "MSIE [1-6]\.";
  gzip_min_length   256;
  gzip_vary         on;
  gzip_proxied      expired no-cache no-store private auth;
  gzip_types        text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
  gzip_comp_level   9;

  root /usr/share/nginx/html;

  location ~ /index.html|.*\.json$ {
  expires -1;
  add_header Cache-Control 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0';
  }

  location ~ .*\.css$|.*\.js$ {
    add_header Cache-Control 'max-age=31449600'; # one year
  }
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
  }
}
```

This adds gzip compression, and adds cache headers for the javascript and css files for one year.

The last portion is *particularly* important (the `location / {...}`) as this tells NginX that instead of sending a 404 for any bad requests, just send `index.html`. This will make it so a load or a refesh on a url that containers Angular routing information will be ignored.

## Build the Image

Run the following (in the directory with your Dockerfile):

```shell
docker build -t jeffrygonzalez/super-angular-app:v1 .
```

Provide your own tag name and version, and don't forget the period at the end.

To run it:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:80 jeffrygonzalez/super-angular-app:v1
```

And hit that sucker with your browsah at `http://localhost:8080`. Your magnifcent Angular app should appear. Check out the network tab for all good caching goodness.

## Build Early, Build Often

Remember you should be rebuilding and redistributing your images often, *even if none of the code changes*. When you build an Angular app, it uses "relative" information
for browser support.
